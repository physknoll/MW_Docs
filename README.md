## Overview ✨

Welcome to **MyWay Datasets**, the gateway to a new standard of AI-driven customer interaction. Our datasets are designed to empower developers, researchers, and businesses by providing comprehensive, merchant-focused data for training Large Language Models (LLMs). 🎉

With MyWay, models gain the depth, nuance, and accuracy needed to represent businesses authentically, enabling them to answer complex customer questions, follow detailed instructions, and align with brand-specific tone and identity. 🌟

---

## Key Features 🗝️

- **Structured for Developers:** Three dataset categories tailored for LLM training:
  - **Pre-training:** Foundational knowledge and context-building.
  - **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT):** Domain-specific adaptation.
  - **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF):** Alignment and accuracy through iterative feedback.

- **Built for RAG & API Access:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and raw data APIs make it simple to integrate real-time, merchant-specific knowledge into your applications. 🌐

- **Merchant-Centric:** Rich Q&A pairs, task-oriented instructions, and feedback loops directly from merchants for unparalleled authenticity.

> **First Release:** February 1st, with datasets refreshed monthly! 🗓️

### 3. Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) Data 🤝
**Purpose:** Continuously improve model accuracy, tone, and relevance through merchant feedback.

**Includes:**
- Model-generated outputs paired with merchant evaluations.
- Corrections, ratings, and preference indicators.
- Structured feedback loops for iterative improvement.

**Use Case:** Align models with individual merchant preferences and ensure factual correctness.
