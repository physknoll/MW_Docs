# MyWay Datasets: Developer Guide 🚀 <!-- {docsify-ignore-all} -->

**Test Update: December 20, 2024 - 23:20 PST - Webhook Test** 🔄

**First Snapshot Release:** **February 1st** 📅

## Overview ✨

Welcome to **MyWay Datasets**, your key to unlocking rich, real-world merchant data for training Large Language Models (LLMs). Instead of relying on sparse FAQs or generic text, our datasets give your models the depth, personality, and accuracy they need to handle business-specific questions and tasks like a pro. 🎉

**What Makes MyWay Special?**
- **Merchant Q&A:** Natural Q&A pairs that reflect *actual* customer inquiries.
- **Merchant Feedback (RLHF):** Direct feedback loops so models stay aligned with brand tone and factual correctness.
- **Interaction Protocols:** Instructional data for multi-step tasks (like placing orders or scheduling appointments).

> **Pro Tip:** Our first dataset snapshot drops **February 1st**! Mark your calendar and stay tuned. 🎯

## Getting Started 🏁

1. **Download the Dataset:**  
   Head over to our [Dataset Portal](#) once it's live on February 1st. Each snapshot includes:
   - JSON/JSONL files with Q&A, RLHF signals, and instructions.
   - Merchant metadata, timestamps, and tags to keep it structured.

2. **Integrate With Your Pipeline:**  
   - **Fine-Tune Your Model:** Add merchant Q&As to align LLMs with real brand contexts.
   - **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** Point your retrieval system to MyWay data so models can ground answers in truthful info.
   - **RLHF Alignment:** Feed merchant feedback into the training loop. Models learn from *actual merchants*—fewer hallucinations, more authenticity.

3. **Real-Time Updates & API Access:**  
   For apps that need fresh info (e.g., product inventory, new offers), talk to us about API access. Sync updates in real-time—no stale data! 🔄
